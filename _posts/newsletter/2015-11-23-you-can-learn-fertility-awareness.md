If you&rsquo;re practically bursting with excitement after reading through the recent emails and blog posts about the sympto-thermal method, I honestly can&rsquo;t blame you. The sympto-thermal method completely transformed the relationship I have with my body, and I know it can do the same for you. If you&rsquo;re ready to learn the method and take advantage of the many ways it can benefit your life and your health, there are lots of ways to learn.

## Read a book. ##

Toni Weschler&rsquo;s book, *Taking Charge of Your Fertility*, is pretty much the bible of fertility awareness. That&rsquo;s how I first got acquainted with the method, and it was so engrossing that I couldn&rsquo;t put it down for days! Weschler does an incredible job of explaining the method in an approachable and easy-to-understand way. It&rsquo;s no wonder that it has killer reviews on Amazon. You can find *Taking Charge of Your Fertility* at your local library or purchase it on Amazon.com.

## Take an online class. ##

I absolutely LOVE that you can take classes on the internet these days! You get to improve that big ole&rsquo; brain of your from the comfort of your couch...it&rsquo;s perfect. My all-time favorite online class for learning the sympto-thermal method was created by Hannah Ransom, the founder of <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://herfertility.simplero.com/S/http://holistichormonalhealth.com/?ref=5706-Groove">Holistic Hormonal Health</a>. Hannah&rsquo;s HER Fertility program is 100% online and you can learn at your own pace. It has everything you need to become a **total** pro. And to top it off, Hannah is just plain awesome. I&rsquo;ve learned a TON from her in the time that I&rsquo;ve known her, and I&rsquo;ve come to consider her a great friend. 

But the best part: you&rsquo;re guaranteed to love Hannah&rsquo;s courses, or she&rsquo;ll give you a FULL REFUND. How freaking awesome is that?!

## Read Groove&rsquo;s online educational info. ##

If you just don&rsquo;t have the cash to spend on an online course (even though I would HIGHLY recommend it), thoroughly reading the free information on Groove&rsquo;s website will get you off to a good start. The more thoroughly you read it, the more empowered and confident you&rsquo;ll feel. More knowledge is always better, so I also recommend supplementing this information with Taking Charge of Your Fertility to get a really solid grasp on the sympto-thermal method.

The information on our website has everything you need to get started, including detailed info about your hormones, an explanation of the sympto-thermal method rules, effectiveness statistics, how to check your cervical fluid and measure your basal body temperature, and how to get the most out of the method. Again, it&rsquo;s super important to read through ALL of the information. There&rsquo;s TONS of info on our website that even the best sex ed classes left out (I&rsquo;ve even heard doctors mention that med school didn&rsquo;t cover this stuff), so don&rsquo;t gloss over it!

## Download the Groove app. ##

I definitely don&rsquo;t recommend relying solely on an app to learn the sympto-thermal method, but apps are fantastic tools that help you put what you&rsquo;re learning into practice. In my opinion, a hands-on approach is the best way to solidify learning! 

Groove&rsquo;s app has customized educational info that is tailored based on your specific cycle and goals...it truly is YOUR app. It explains the sympto-thermal method as it relates to your body, and it helps you gain an understanding of what data to track and why. It even includes sample data that will help promote learning.
