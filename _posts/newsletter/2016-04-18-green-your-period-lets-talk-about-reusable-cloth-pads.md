I have a confession: I HATE disposable pads with the fiery passion of a thousand suns. They're bulky, itchy, uncomfortable, and (not to mention) loaded with endocrine disrupting chemicals that contribute to period problems. As a teen, wearing them made me feel super subconscious about my body. Now, I've COMPLETELY changed my tune...all thanks to cloth pads! After watching this week's video, I think you'll agree.
