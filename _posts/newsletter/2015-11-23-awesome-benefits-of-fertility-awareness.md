When I first found fertility awareness, I knew I&rsquo;d found a great birth control method. What I wasn&rsquo;t expecting, though, was the power to pinpoint the underlying cause of my severe menstrual cramps and probable endometriosis that I had been struggling with for more than a decade. When I found fertility awareness, I was never expecting to discover a link between my horrible periods, my cyclical anxiety, and the chronic constipation that had persisted since my childhood. I never dreamed that fertility awareness would give me the information and tools I needed to rebalance my hormones and all but eliminate the cramps I used to think were coded into my DNA. But it did. And it can do all of that (AND MORE) for you!

If any of these things apply to you, fertility awareness (specifically, the sympto-thermal method) can probably help you.

1. Do you experience crazy mood swings before your periods?
2. Do you have PCOS, fibroids, or endometriosis?
3. Do your periods seem to play hide-and-seek with you?
4. Do you have mind-numbing cramps every month that interfere with your daily activities?
5. Do you spot like crazy before your period?
6. Is your menstrual flow insanely heavy or clotted?
7. Have you had difficulty getting pregnant?
8. Do you struggle with anxiety or another mood disorder?
9. Do your periods seem to show up unannounced whenever the heck they want?

<br/>

If you fall into any of the above categories, you&rsquo;re definitely not in the minority (I used to be right there with you!). If you struggle with any of these things, it&rsquo;s likely your body&rsquo;s way of telling you that something isn&rsquo;t quite right. The cause could be a hormone imbalance, food sensitivities, adrenal fatigue (caused by chronic stress), or even an imbalance in your gut bacteria. Regardless of the root cause, fertility awareness can help.

###But how?

Let&rsquo;s revisit the Google Analytics analogy that I mentioned in the previous email (for those who forgot: fertility awareness is like Google Analytics for your vagina). Google Analytics provides data that can be used to improve your website&rsquo;s performance and user engagement (to name a few), leading to greater success. You can think of fertility awareness in the same way: the menstrual cycle data you gather each day provides insights that help you make changes in your life that will improve the health of your body. 

Fertility awareness isn&rsquo;t just something that crunchy, earthy, hippie gals use to feel more connected to the cosmos (or whatever the stereotype is). It&rsquo;s so much more than that, and hopefully I&rsquo;ve started to convince you of that by now. It&rsquo;s a practical way to take control of your well-being and help you make your body the healthiest it can be!
