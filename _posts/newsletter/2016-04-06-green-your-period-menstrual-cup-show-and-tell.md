"Green Your Period" is our latest video series all about why sustainable and eco-friendly period products are great for your health and for the environment. The first Green Your Period video covered the health and environmental implications of using disposables, and this video be a show and tell of menstrual cups. If you don't know what a menstrual cup is, that's okay! This video covers what they are, how to use them, how to clean them, how to choose the right one for your body, and why they're awesome (obviously).

## Find your perfect menstrual cup ##

As promised, here is the info to help you find your *perfect* menstrual cup. As I explained in the video, your cervix (which is the lower part of your uterus) drops down in the vagina during your period. That means the dimensions of your menstrual cup are super important to ensure a proper fit! To figure out what size cup you need, insert a finger into your vagina until you hit your cervix (it will feel like a hard nub with a small opening in the middle) on the heaviest day of your next period. Once you determine how low or high your cervix is sitting, reference the info below to figure out which cup size is best for your body.

### Your cervix is too high to reach ###

If your cervix is crazy high, you're a lucky duck &mdash; you can pretty much take your pick with menstrual cups and it will probably work out perfectly! But if you want something that will hold the greatest amount of fluid, I recommend the <a class="text-link" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FG4YEM/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005FG4YEM&linkCode=as2&tag=groove07-20&linkId=B4FZWQVTKBAHP6QL">DivaCup model 1</a>, <a class="text-link" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAG6XA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000FAG6XA&linkCode=as2&tag=groove07-20&linkId=E2VPRF3V45TJXGH7">DivaCup model 2</a>, or the <a class="text-link" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XFN58AG/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00XFN58AG&linkCode=as2&tag=groove07-20&linkId=RISUNVWUBNWJPPBG">MeLuna XL</a>. 

### Your cervix is one index finger deep ###

If you can barely reach your cervix with your index finger on the heaviest day of your period, there are several great menstrual cup options for you! I recommend <a class="text-link" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XFNYZLE/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00XFNYZLE&linkCode=as2&tag=groove07-20&linkId=Z7YNZVT6RZDV7D3M">MeLuna M</a> or <a class="text-link" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XFN0MF2/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00XFN0MF2&linkCode=as2&tag=groove07-20&linkId=WWISUG5BMRYXIWY4">MeLuna L</a> for the greatest capacity. You can also choose from any of the cups in the categories below!

### Your cervix is 2&ndash;3 knuckles deep ###

If your cervix is on the lower side but you can insert almost a full index finger on the heaviest day of your period before hitting it, you've got lots of great options. I recommend the <a class="text-link" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QSB1DJW/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00QSB1DJW&linkCode=as2&tag=groove07-20&linkId=452AE7342BNCTYRH">MeLuna S</a>, <a class="text-link" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054SD2BW/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0054SD2BW&linkCode=as2&tag=groove07-20&linkId=BRXZZXV5OYROHI6I">Lunette Model 1</a>, <a class="text-link" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054SQ02K/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0054SQ02K&linkCode=as2&tag=groove07-20&linkId=Z2CNNEOXTH7M2GO7">Lunette Model 2</a>, <a class="text-link" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GQIFY4C/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00GQIFY4C&linkCode=as2&tag=groove07-20&linkId=OO7BNMERGIZABETN">Skooncup Model 2</a>, <a class="text-link" href="http://meluna-usa.com/index.php/meluna-usa-store#!/Classic-Ball-AMETHYST-Shorty/p/49613026/category=7122492">MeLuna Shorty L</a>, or <a class="text-link" href="http://meluna-usa.com/index.php/meluna-usa-store#!/Classic-Ball-AMETHYST-Shorty/p/49613026/category=7122492">MeLuna Shorty XL</a>. If you want a high capacity cup that you won't have to change very often, I recommend the MeLuna S or the Lunette Model 2. If you've given birth, you'll want the Lunette Model 2 or the Skooncup Model 2. 

### Your cervix is 2 knuckles deep or less ###

If you've got a super low cervix like me, your options are a bit more limited, unfortunately. BUT, there are still awesome cups that will work great for you! I recommend the <a class="text-link" href="http://meluna-usa.com/index.php/meluna-usa-store#!/Classic-Ball-AMETHYST-Shorty/p/49613026/category=7122492">MeLuna Shorty S</a> (that's the one I personally use), the <a class="text-link" href="http://meluna-usa.com/index.php/meluna-usa-store#!/Classic-Ball-AMETHYST-Shorty/p/49613026/category=7122492">MeLuna Shorty M</a>, or the <a class="text-link" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GQIFY7E/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00GQIFY7E&linkCode=as2&tag=groove07-20&linkId=4JTOR7ALA2S3NLKR">Skooncup Model 1</a>. The <a class="text-link" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GQIFY7E/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00GQIFY7E&linkCode=as2&tag=groove07-20&linkId=4JTOR7ALA2S3NLKR">Skooncup Model 1</a> is your best bet if you want a high capacity, but you'll have to shorten the stem for this one to work for you. It's super easy to do, and all you have to do is clip the stem to your desired length with scissors. Done and done!
