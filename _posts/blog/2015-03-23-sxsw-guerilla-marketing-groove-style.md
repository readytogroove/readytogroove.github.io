<a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="http://sxsw.com/">SXSW</a> has officially come and gone from our home base in Austin, TX, and it was a blast! 

Here at Groove, we love a good project. So when we decided we wanted to pull off an awesome marketing campaign during SXSW, we knew we had to do it guerilla style.

So we ordered a couple banners with the Groove logo gloriously displayed in giant text. And we just *HAD* to build something to attach the banners to our car...from scratch! So off to Home Depot we went. We stayed up until 2 a.m. the night before SXSW Interactive cutting and gluing PVC to get it just right. Check out the finished product!

Brian and I drove around Austin during SXSW with the windows rolled down, blaring &lsquo;70s groove tunes like &ldquo;Shake Your Groove Thing&rdquo; and &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Groove.&rdquo; Needless to say, many groove things were shaken&mdash;including ours!

In between driving the Groovemobile, we walked around town with signs hanging from our necks that read &ldquo;Free condoms&rdquo; and &ldquo;Free tampons,&rdquo; passing out said items to festival-goers. (Don&rsquo;t worry, we took turns wearing each sign!) 

There was just *no way* we could pass up an opportunity to hand out free tampons! And our efforts were not in vain.

There were more than a few gals in need who profusely thanked us for saving their days (and their outfits). That in itself made our efforts 100% worth it.

Overall, the week was a huge success. The mantra &ldquo;Keep Austin Weird&rdquo; is what we do best here at Groove.
