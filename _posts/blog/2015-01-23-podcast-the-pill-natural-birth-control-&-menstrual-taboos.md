It&rsquo;s no secret that <a class="text-link" href="/blog/2014/03/15/finding-fertility-awareness-my-birth-control-story/">my path to finding the sympto-thermal method of fertility awareness</a> was filled with ups and downs (let&rsquo;s be real...mostly downs). I *love* sharing my experience with others, so when Lisa over at <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="http://fertilityfriday.com/">Fertility Friday</a> got in touch with me about doing a podcast with her, I was SO down!  

We had an amazing chat about my experience with the pill, how I found the sympto-thermal method of fertility awareness, why I wrote <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://leanpub.com/the-cycle/">The Cycle</a>, what led me to start Groove, and what I think the future holds for fertility charting.
