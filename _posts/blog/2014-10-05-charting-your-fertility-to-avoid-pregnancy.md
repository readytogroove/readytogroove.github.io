Effectively avoiding pregnancy without hormones or devices is slightly more complicated than making a sacrifice to the vagina gods or relying on the good old-fashioned &ldquo;pull-and-pray.&rdquo; Luckily, avoiding pregnancy using your body&rsquo;s own data is easy to learn, and it&rsquo;s also really darn effective (we&rsquo;re talking <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/5/1310.full">on par with the pill</a>).

###The Basics

Sperm can live up to five days inside your body waiting to fertilize an egg, and an egg lives for up to 24 hours after it&rsquo;s ovulated. All-in-all, that&rsquo;s about a six-day window when it&rsquo;s actually possible to get pregnant, and charting your fertility helps you figure out exactly when this “fertile phase” occurs.

So just how do you know what days you&rsquo;re fertile? There are two primary signs of fertility that you&rsquo;ll need to monitor to figure out when you are and aren&rsquo;t at risk of a pregnancy: cervical fluid and basal body temperature. 

###Cervical Fluid

Cervical fluid is, hands down, the most important measure of fertility. 

Cervical fluid is a secretion produced by your cervix in response to hormone changes, and it&rsquo;s the whole reason sperm can survive inside your body. Without this fluid, they die within several hours before an egg can ever be fertilized. So the fact that this fluid is only produced during a portion of your cycle is pretty important. It&rsquo;s the whole reason this method works so well to prevent pregnancy. 

###Basal Body Temperature

Basal body temperature (BBT) &ndash; which is taken when you first wake up &ndash; picks up on the hormone changes that occur just after ovulation, letting you know that your egg has been released. Since your egg will die after about 24 hours, measuring your temperature every day helps you figure out when your egg is dead and gone and a pregnancy is no longer possible. 

Yes, it&rsquo;s possible to ovulate twice, but there&rsquo;s a silver lining here. If you ovulate a second time, it will happen within 24 hours of the first egg. So once you&rsquo;ve confirmed ovulation using your BBT, you&rsquo;re home free until your next cycle.

###The Rules

Monitoring the changes in your cervical fluid and BBT make up a method called the sympto-thermal method (STM). Charting your fertility (and avoiding pregnancy) with STM requires that you follow a simple set of rules.
