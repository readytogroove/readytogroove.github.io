All throughout high school and college, I would count days on a calendar in a vain attempt to predict my next period. If I started my period on the sixth of the month, I&rsquo;d put a little star on the sixth of the next month. *Close enough, right?* Things always ended in disappointment (and unfortunate stains). There&rsquo;s nothing worse than being completely unprepared for a period sneak-attack.

The good news is, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be this frustrating. Whether your cycles are like clockwork or feel more like a broken clock, it *is possible* to accurately predict your periods.

###Your body is not the average body.

The first thing you need to realize is that your cycles are unique. Your cycles are totally different than someone else&rsquo;s cycles, and we built <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id831795151">the Groove app</a> to reflect that. That&rsquo;s why Groove automatically customizes and adapts...*just for you*! When you open Groove for the very first time, you&rsquo;ll answer a few simple questions about your goals and the regularity (or lack thereof) of your cycles. Using this info, Groove automatically customizes so that *your* app reflects *you*.

###Irregular cycles? Not to fear.

Irregular cycles are frustrating and unpredictable, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean period predictions can&rsquo;t work for you. Irregular cycles are more complex, so why is it that most apps treat all cycles the same? To make Groove accurate even for irregular cycles, we let you know what data you should be tracking every day. There&rsquo;s also tons of info in the app that&rsquo;s highly customized, so you&rsquo;ll be able to learn about irregular cycles and other info that applies to *you*.

If you&rsquo;re confused about what data to add or need a bit of help getting started, we&rsquo;ve got you covered. There&rsquo;s tons of educational info in the app and on our website that will teach you everything you need to know to take advantage of what Groove has to offer.

###Learn about your body.

Whether or not you have irregular cycles, there&rsquo;s always something to learn. Are you ovulating? Do you have an undiagnosed hormone imbalance? Or <a class="text-link" href="/blog/2015/01/09/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-what-it-is-&-what-you-should-know/">polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)</a>? Will you struggle with infertility down the road? You can help answer each of these questions by <a class="text-link" href="/blog/2014/09/12/4-awesome-reasons-to-get-in-tune-with-your-cycle/">getting in tune with your cycles</a>. Your body provides you with a live stream of data *every single day*, and we&rsquo;re here to help you make sense of it.
