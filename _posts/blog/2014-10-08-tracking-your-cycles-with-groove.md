All throughout high school and college, I would count days on a calendar as a way of trying to predict my next period. If I started my period on the sixth of the month, I&rsquo;d put a little star on the sixth of the next month, thinking that this would probably be close enough. But I was always disappointed. And there&rsquo;s nothing worse than being completely unprepared for a period sneak-attack.

Good news. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be this frustrating. Whether your cycles are like clockwork or feel more like a broken clock, it is possible to accurately predict your periods.

###How Groove can help:

Your cycles aren&rsquo;t like every other woman&rsquo;s cycles. They&rsquo;re unique, and we wanted our app to reflect that. That&rsquo;s why we built Groove to automatically customize...just for you! When you open our app for the very first time, you&rsquo;ll be asked to answer a few questions about your goals and the regularity (or lack thereof) of your cycles. This helps you get the most from the app.

###Got Irregular Cycles?

Irregular cycles are frustrating and unpredictable, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean period predictions can&rsquo;t work for you. Most apps predict periods the same way for every woman, even though irregular cycles are more complex. To make Groove accurate even for irregular cycles, we customize the types of data you should enter to get the most from the app. Even our prediction algorithms are different for irregular cycles.

If you&rsquo;re confused about what data to add or need a bit of help getting started, we&rsquo;ve got you covered. There&rsquo;s tons of educational info in the app that will teach you everything you need to know.

###Learn about your body

Whether or not you have irregular cycles, there&rsquo;s always something to learn. Are you ovulating? Do you have undiagnosed hormone imbalance? Or polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)? Will you struggle with infertility down the road? You can help answer each of these questions by <a class="text-link" href="/blog/2014/09/12/4-awesome-reasons-to-get-in-tune-with-your-cycle/">getting in tune with your cycles</a>. Your body gives you tons of data each month, and we want to help you make sense of it.
