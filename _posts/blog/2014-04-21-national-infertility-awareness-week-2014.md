This week is National Infertility Awareness Week, so I wanted to take a few minutes to discuss this important topic with you.

Starting Groove has afforded me the opportunity to meet many individuals who have struggled with infertility, and I feel incredibly privileged that so many people have shared these intensely personal experiences with me. Infertility is an issue that has become deeply personal to me and my team.

Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive after 12 months of trying to conceive, and it affects as many as 1 in 8 couples. It is estimated that infertility is caused by male and female factors equally&mdash;each is attributed to about 30% of cases. So while it's important for women struggling with infertility to discuss options with their doctors, many people don't realize that it's _equally_ important for men to be informed about their options.

There's nothing that can completely eliminate the pain that comes with navigating infertility, but being educated and aware of your options can help you make treatment decisions from a place of knowledge and insight. Understanding the <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/chapter-4-female-reproductive-organs-and-endocrine-glands">female reproductive system</a> is an important place to start. While men are fertile every day, this is not the case for women. Knowing how to determine a woman's most fertile time can help maximize chances of conception, and this knowledge can be invaluable for couples struggling with infertility. 

Groove is committed to providing you with <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/">the information</a> and <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id831795151">tools</a> necessary to achieve your goals, whatever they may be.
