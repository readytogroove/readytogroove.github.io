Based on the sheer number of emails we&rsquo;ve received asking us when Groove will be available for Android, it&rsquo;s obvious to us that period trackers for Android just aren&rsquo;t cutting it. That&rsquo;s all about to change, because Groove for Android is finally on its way. I could go on and on about why Groove is so amazing, but I don&rsquo;t want you to take my word for it. Here&rsquo;s what some of our users have to say about it:

##Our users love Groove##

&ldquo;As someone who is very busy, Groove is perfect. This is an app ahead of its time and really puts women first. I love how you can tailor the features to suit your individual needs. It is a must have in every woman&rsquo;s life!&rdquo;

&ldquo;As someone with an irregular period, Groove is super helpful for me keeping track of my body and its shenanigans!&rdquo;

&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s start with the fact that this app isn&rsquo;t pink or covered in flowers. I, for one, like to be treated like an adult and not an eight year old while tracking my lady things. Second, this app represents the data wonderfully and is so intuitive. 10 STARS!!&rdquo;

&ldquo;This is what I&rsquo;ve been looking for all along. Wish I hadn&rsquo;t paid for so many other period apps because Groove blows them all out of the water. It is perfect.&rdquo;

##Help us get Groove ready for Android##

We&rsquo;re recruiting beta testers to help us prepare Groove for its Android release, and we&rsquo;re looking for people like you to get involved. Being a beta tester will be as simple as using the app as you normally would and quickly informing us of any problems you discover. And, as a perk, you get access to new features before they go public.

Helping people get in tune with their bodies is a rewarding job, and I&rsquo;m excited for Groove to expand its impact with Android. With your help, we&rsquo;ll bring an incredible period tracker to the world&rsquo;s Android users.

Sign up to beta test by clicking the button below, or by sending an email to howdy@readytogroove.com.
