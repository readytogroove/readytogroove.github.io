Deciphering your cycles isn't always easy &mdash; everyone's body is a little different. But once you know what to look out for, collecting data about your periods can give you a powerful look into the health of your hormones, your reproductive system, and your body. Take a gander at the sample Groove charts below to learn how to visualize things like your fertile phase, a pregnancy, miscarriage, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), anovulation, irregular cycles, hormonal imbalance, delayed ovulation, and more!

## The fertile phase ##

{% include image.html url="/img/book/sympto-thermal-fertility-awareness-method-rules-sudden-temperature-shift.jpg" %}

The fertile phase in the above cycle begins on Cycle Day 8 when cervical fluid production begins. Since this person experienced a <strong>sudden</strong> temperature shift on Day 16, the Peak Day Rule is satisfied on the 3rd day after their Peak Day. The Temperature Shift Rule is satisfied on the 3rd consecutive day of a basal body temperature that is above the coverline, since that third temperature is at least 0.3 &deg;F (0.15 &deg;C) above the coverline. The fertile phase ends in the evening on Cycle Day 18, since that is when both the Peak Day Rule and the Temperature Shift Rule are satisfied.

## Irregular cycles &amp; PCOS ##

Individuals with highly irregular cycles or PCOS may experience long periods of time with slippery, fertile cervical fluid production. It's common to have multiple false peaks, or peak days that are not followed by a temperature shift indicative of ovulation.

## Stopping hormonal contraception ##

Since hormonal contraception halts your body's natural hormone production, it can take up to a year for your cycles to fully recover once you stop taking it. During the first few post-hormone cycles &mdash; while your body is working to kickstart its own hormones &mdash; it's common to experience erratic temperatures, unusual cervical fluid patterns, mood disturbances, and delayed ovulation.

## Anovulation ##

Anovulation, or a menstrual cycle in which ovulation doesn't actually happen, can happen for many reasons. Anovulation can occur in an individual with otherwise healthy menstrual cycles in response to extreme stress, heavy exercise, 

## Pregnancy ##

Their peak day occurs on cycle day 14 and their temperature shift occurs on cycle day 16. Therefore, the end of the fertile window occurs on cycle day 18 when BOTH the temperature shift rule AND the peak day rule are satisfied. If menstruation had lasted for six days, cycle day six would be considered fertile according to the First Five Days Rule." %}

## Postpartum ##
