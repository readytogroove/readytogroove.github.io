When Brian and I started Groove, we knew we wanted it to be great. But what does that mean, really? Does making a great product mean making it look good? Does it mean having kick-ass software? Is a "great" product one that's easy to use?

Creating great products at Groove is more than writing code, whipping up designs, and knowing our stuff. For us, it means never compromising our standards of quality (and they're pretty darned high). It means never making decisions haphazardly, and having you, our customer, in mind with every single thing we do. 

Truly great products are hard to find&mdash;especially great products made specifically for women. We want to help change that. We want to help set a new standard of quality for other companies like us, because women deserve amazing products. 

We want you to feel a connection when you use our app&mdash;the type of connection that can only be created when a product is crafted by a ridiculously passionate team of individuals. 

We love what we do, and we hope that it shows every time you use our products. Groove's app is just the tip of the iceberg for us, and we're thrilled to have you along for the ride.
