This week is National Women's Health Week (NWHW), and it probably comes as no surprise that I'm super pumped about it! The goal of NWHW, according to <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="http://womenshealth.gov/nwhw/learn/index.html">WomensHealth.gov</a> is &quot;to empower women to make their health a priority&quot;...how could I _not_ totally get behind that?!

NWHW is a great opportunity to add some healthy habits to your life, and there are so many ways to participate. Here are just a few of my personal favorite ways to improve your health and feel your best:

###Up your activity level

A great way to improve your health and wellbeing (and to de-stress), is to add a little movement to your life! It can be something as simple as going for a walk during your lunch break. I can often be found doing this when I'm feeling stressed or overwhelmed at work. It's an excellent way to help me clear my head and get my blood (and creativity) moving. Plus, it's always great to get out in the sunshine!

Another thing I've been known to do is take short, 5-minute breaks during work to do a few exercises. Anything from pushups, to squats, to jumping jacks! It may seem totally silly&mdash;and it probably looks ridiculous&mdash;but the benefits are seriously amazing. It's a good way to refocus and get those endorphins flowing when you feel your attention drifting.

###Nom on some veggies

Veggies are no doubt good for us, but it's not always easy to incorporate more of them into your diet, especially if you're not fond of them. Growing up, I hated probably almost any vegetable you can name. But now, I can frequently be caught snacking on anything from carrots, to green beans, to kale...yum! _And I actually like it!_

If you're struggling to up your intake of veggies, something that really helps me out is to experiment with different ways to eat them. I wasn't always crazy about cucumbers, but sliced cucumbers tossed in an _amazing_ and simple <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wholeliving.com/132527/dill-shallot-vinaigrette">dill and shallot vinaigrette</a>? Yes, please!

###Be happy!

Emotional wellbeing and happiness is super important when it comes to maintaining good overall health. We all know that feeling of getting totally overwhelmed and then feeling awful, or even getting sick, as a result. Being happy is sometimes easier said than done, but there are definitely things you can do to help yourself out!

One thing that has been _immensely_ helpful for me has been to give myself a little timeout every day. And no, not the timeouts you got as a kid for misbehaving! The timeouts I take are a time to sit and reflect on my day. It's a time for me to think through things that might be bothering me, reflect on all the amazing things in my life, mentally organize my schedule, and generally just decompress from my day.

You can even take your timeouts _while_ doing another activity like yoga, cycling, or going for a walk. A little personal quiet time each day can go a long way.

###Listen to your body

Being in tune with your body is totally underrated, in my opinion. It's so important to listen to what your body is telling you and then to react accordingly. Are you feeling totally stressed and exhausted? Give yourself a little TLC by getting some exercise, adding some extra sleep, and eating a few more fruits and veggies. Little changes can make a big difference!

I struggled with a grumpy reproductive system for years...can you say MEGA CRAMPS?! I upped my fruits and veggies, made an effort to de-stress, cut out refined foods, and adjusted my habits based on what my body was telling me. The results have been AH-mazing, and I feel better than I ever have. No more grumpy lady parts!

Whether you listen to your body by <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id831795151">tracking fertility signs with our app</a> to improve your reproductive health, or by making an effort to slow down and enjoy all the awesome things life has to offer, listening to your body provides great insight.

Here's to taking small steps towards a healthier you! 

XOXO,
