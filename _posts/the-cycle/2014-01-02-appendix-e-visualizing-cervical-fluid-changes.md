I could talk all day long about cervical fluid, but being able to visualize the changes that occur during your cycle is a powerful teaching tool. Shown below is one example of changes in cervical fluid that occurred during a single menstrual cycle. Each body is unique, and so is each cervical fluid pattern! The images shown below cannot possibly represent all of the many variations in cervical fluid, but hopefully it will make it easier to determine the different fluid types.


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/dry-cervical-fluid.png" description="No cervical fluid (above) - No cervical fluid is present, but you can see a slight moistness on the middle finger due to vaginal fluid." %}


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/sticky-cervical-fluid-1.jpg" description="Sticky cervical fluid (above) - Fluid categorized as sticky can be tacky, pasty, or gummy, and it will usually be white or pale yellow in color. Even though it is possible for this type of fluid to have some stretch to it, its low water content means that it will not feel slippery or lubricative." %}


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/creamy-cervical-fluid-1.jpg" description="Creamy cervical fluid (above) - Fluid categorized as creamy will be wetter than sticky fluid, but will not feel slippery or lubricative. It may take on a milky or lotiony feel." %}


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/creamy-cervical-fluid-2.jpg" description="Creamy cervical fluid (above) - This day had much more creamy fluid than the previous day, but it still will not feel slippery or lubricative." %}

{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/egg-white-cervical-fluid-1.jpg" description="Egg white cervical fluid (above) - Notice that this fluid is beginning to stretch. However, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily point to egg white cervical fluid. Egg white fluid will feel slippery and lubricative between your fingers, similar to a raw egg white (hence the name). Not all egg white fluid will be perfectly clear...as you can see, this fluid is streaked!" %}


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/egg-white-cervical-fluid-2.jpg" description="Egg white cervical fluid (above) - There is more egg white fluid present today than yesterday. Again, this fluid appears streaked, which is common. This fluid is very stretchy and feels slippery and lubricative because of the increased water content. Remember, stretchy doesn&rsquo;t always point to egg white, so pay attention to how slippery it feels!" %}


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/watery-cervical-fluid.png" description="Thin, egg white cervical fluid (above) - This fluid is highly fertile. It has a very high water content and feels extremely slippery and lubricative. This type of fluid often causes a leaky feeling and a cold vaginal sensation. Today is the peak day for this cycle, as explained in the next image." %}


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/sticky-cervical-fluid-2.jpg" description="Sticky cervical fluid (above) - The cervical fluid has now begun a drying pattern and is back to feeling pasty and tacky. Yesterday was the last day of slippery, highly fertile fluid, so it is considered the peak day. Although the peak day may fall on the day with the greatest amount of slippery, fertile fluid, that is not always the case. Peak day is defined as the last day of slippery, fertile-quality fluid. It&rsquo;s important to note that the cervical fluid you experience after your peak day may still stretch a bit, but it will no longer feel slippery or lubricative." %}

Cervical fluid can tell you a lot about the state of your hormone (and period) health. Having tons and tons of cervical fluid usually indicates abnormally high levels of the sex hormone estrogen (and potentially low levels of the sex hormone progesterone), while too little cervical fluid can mean the opposite. Healthy hormones and healthy periods are absolutely VITAL for good overall health. Unhealthy periods (complete with cramps, acne, bloating, mood swings, food cravings, low libido, etc.) have a major affect on the health of EVERY system in your body &mdash; your mental health, your digestive health, your immune system health, your skin health, and even your sleep. Crazy, right? If you struggle with period problems, you're not necessarily sentenced to a lifetime of monthly misery.
