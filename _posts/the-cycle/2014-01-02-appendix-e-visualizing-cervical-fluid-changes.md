I could talk all day long about cervical fluid, but being able to visualize the changes that occur is a powerful teaching tool. Shown below is one example of changes in cervical fluid that occurred during a single menstrual cycle. Each body is unique, and so is each cervical fluid pattern! The images shown below cannot possibly represent all of the many variations in cervical fluid, but hopefully it will make it easier to determine the different fluid types.


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/dry-cervical-fluid.png" description="<strong>No cervical fluid</strong> (above) - No cervical fluid is present, but you can see a slight moistness on the middle finger due to vaginal fluid." %}


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/sticky-cervical-fluid-1.jpg" description="<strong>Sticky cervical fluid</strong> (above) - Fluid categorized as sticky can be tacky, pasty, or gummy. Even though it is possible for this type of fluid to have some stretch to it, its low water content means that it will not feel slippery or lubricative." %}


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/creamy-cervical-fluid-1.jpg" description="<strong>Creamy cervical fluid</strong> (above) - Fluid categorized as creamy will be wetter than sticky fluid, but will not feel slippery or lubricative. It may take on a milky or lotiony feel." %}


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/creamy-cervical-fluid-2.jpg" description="<strong>Creamy cervical fluid</strong> (above) - This day had much more creamy fluid than the previous day, but it still will not feel slippery or lubricative." %}


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/egg-white-cervical-fluid-1.jpg" description="<strong>Egg white cervical fluid</strong> (above) - Notice that this fluid is beginning to stretch. It will feel slippery and lubricative between your fingers. Not all egg white fluid will be perfectly clear...as you can see, this fluid is streaked!" %}


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/egg-white-cervical-fluid-2.jpg" description="<strong>Egg white cervical fluid</strong> (above) - There is more egg white fluid present today than yesterday. This fluid is very stretchy and will feel slippery because of the increased water content. Again, it is streaked, which is common." %}


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/watery-cervical-fluid.png" description="<strong>Thin, egg white cervical fluid</strong> (above) - This fluid is highly fertile. It has a very high water content and feels very slippery and lubricative. It will still stretch a bit, but has a much higher water content than the previous day. This type of fluid often causes a leaky feeling and a cold vaginal sensation. Today is the peak day for this cycle, as explained in the next image." %}


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/sticky-cervical-fluid-2.jpg" description="<strong>Sticky cervical fluid</strong> (above) - The cervical fluid has now begun a drying pattern and is back to feeling pasty and tacky. Yesterday was the last day of slippery, highly fertile fluid, so it is considered the peak day. Although the peak day may fall on the day with the greatest amount of slippery, fertile fluid, it is defined as the <strong>last day</strong> of slippery, fertile-quality fluid. It&rsquo;s important to note that the cervical fluid you experience after your peak day may still be stretchy, but it will no longer feel slippery." %}
