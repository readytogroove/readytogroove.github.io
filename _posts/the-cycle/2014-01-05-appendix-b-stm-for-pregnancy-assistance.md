Using the sympto-thermal method (STM) to achieve a pregnancy, in theory, is simply the opposite of using it for pregnancy prevention. If a woman knows when she's in her fertile window and she wants to avoid a pregnancy, all she has to do is avoid sex; if she wants to achieve a pregnancy, she simply has to have sex during her fertile window, right? Well, yes and no. Though there is about an 85% chance that a couple will get pregnant over the course of a year when using no method of contraception, there are days during the fertile window when sex is _more_ likely to result in a pregnancy. Namely, any day during the fertile window when cervical fluid is clear, very stretchy, or slippery will be extremely fertile. If spotting is present, even better! The trick is to try to time intercourse as close to the day of ovulation as possible, which can feel like somewhat of a guessing game. However, if you compare the stress of using STM to the stress of having no knowledge of STM and trying to time sex based on an "average" woman's cycle, it's far less of a shot in the dark. One must also take into account that a man's sperm count will not be as high if he ejaculated the previous day. So for pregnancy achievement, timing sex for days when cervical fluid has the highest water content will result in the greatest chances of conception. 

Not only is STM great at taking much the guesswork out of becoming pregnant, it also essentially replaces the need to take a pregnancy test! Before I explain why, let's talk biology (not too much, though). As we know by now, the corpus luteum secretes progesterone during the luteal phase to thicken and maintain the uterine lining. If the egg is, in fact, fertilized and implants into the uterus, it will secrete a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin, or hCG. This hCG tells the corpus luteum not to break down, as it typically would right before menstruation. So, rather than stopping progesterone production, the corpus luteum is given somewhat of a second wind, and continues progesterone production to maintain the uterine lining needed by the developing embryo. Since progesterone is the hormone responsible for the rise in BBT directly after ovulation, this continued production thanks to the implanted embryo causes BBT to _stay high_. So by measuring BBT, it's easy to detect when a woman is very likely pregnant. **If a woman's BBT stays high for at least 18 consecutive days after the initial temperature shift, it is fairly safe to assume that she is pregnant** [<a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/notes/#note62">62</a>].

A couple sample pregnancy charts are shown below.

After 18 days of a consecutively high BBT, she can assume that she is pregnant. A triphasic pattern&mdash;or a BBT that increases a second time, as seen starting on cycle day 20&mdash;is often typical of a woman who is, in fact, pregnant." %}

On cycle day 23, her temperature fell to the coverline, which is known to happen from time to time during the luteal phase. She also experienced a triphasic pattern, since her BBT rose for a second time on cycle day 32. After 18 days of an elevated temperature, she can assume that she is almost certainly pregnant." %}


##Miscarriage


Unfortunately, a pregnancy resulting in a miscarriage is sometimes a fact of life. It's never an easy situation to encounter, especially when that pregnancy is wanted. Although I so hope that anyone reading this book never suffers through such an event, it is good to understand the warning signs. If a pregnancy has been confirmed (or indirectly confirmed by 18 days of an elevated post-ovulatory BBT) and BBT begins to fall after that point, it may be an indication of an impending miscarriage [<a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/notes/#note63">63</a>]. See the sample chart on the next page.

She, unfortunately, experiences a miscarriage after 20 days of a high BBT and a confirmed pregnancy." %}


I would also recommend reading through <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/appendix-c-the-sympto-thermal-method-for-reproductive-health">Appendix C</a> for information on reproductive disorders that can lead to difficulty achieving a pregnancy or carrying a pregnancy to term.
