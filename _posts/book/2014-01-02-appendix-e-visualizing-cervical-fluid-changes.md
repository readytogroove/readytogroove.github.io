I could talk all day long about cervical fluid, but being able to visualize the changes that occur is a powerful teaching tool. Shown below is one example of changes in cervical fluid that occurred during a single menstrual cycle. Each woman is unique, and so is her cervical fluid! The images shown below cannot possibly represent all of the many variations in cervical fluid, but hopefully it will make it easier to determine the different fluid types.


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/cervical-fluid1.png" description="No cervical fluid - (above) No cervical fluid is present, but you can see a slight moistness on the middle finger from vaginal fluid." %}


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/cervical-fluid3.jpg" description="Sticky cervical fluid - (above) Fluid categorized as sticky can be tacky, pasty, or gummy. It has a low water content and will not stretch." %}


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/cervical-fluid4.jpg" description="Creamy cervical fluid - (above) Fluid categorized as creamy will be wetter than sticky fluid, but will not stretch. It may take on a milky or lotiony feel." %}


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/cervical-fluid5.jpg" description="Creamy cervical fluid - (above) This day had much more creamy fluid than the previous day, but it still will not stretch." %}


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/cervical-fluid6.jpg" description="Egg white cervical fluid - (above) Notice that this fluid is beginning to stretch. It will feel slippery between your fingers. Not all egg white fluid will be perfectly clear...as you can see, this fluid is streaked!" %}


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/cervical-fluid7.jpg" description="Egg white cervical fluid - (above) There is more egg white fluid present today than yesterday. This fluid is very stretchy and will feel slippery because of the increased water content. Again, it is streaked, which is common." %}


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/cervical-fluid8.png" description="Watery cervical fluid - (above) This fluid is *highly fertile*. It has a very high water content and feels very slippery. It will still stretch a bit, but has a much higher water content than the previous day. This type of fluid often causes a leaky feeling. Today is the peak day for this cycle, as explained in the next image." %}


{% include cf-image.html url="/img/book/cervical-fluid9.jpg" description="Sticky cervical fluid - (above) The cervical fluid has now begun a drying pattern and is back to feeling pasty and tacky. Yesterday was the last day of slippery, highly fertile fluid, so it is considered the peak day. Although the peak day may fall on the day with the greatest amount of slippery, fertile fluid, it is defined as the *last day* of slippery, fertile-quality fluid." %}
