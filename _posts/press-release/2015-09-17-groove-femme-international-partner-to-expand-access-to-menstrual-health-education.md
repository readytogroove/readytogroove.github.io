**Austin, TX &ndash;** Today, Austin-based women&rsquo;s health startup, Groove, and Canadian NGO, Femme International, announce a new partnership.

<a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.femmeinternational.org/">Femme International</a> is an NGO that delivers feminine hygiene education and sustainable menstrual products to school-aged girls in East Africa in hopes of breaking down menstruation-related stigmas. Groove, maker of the <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id831795151">Groove Period &amp; Fertility Tracker</a> app for iPhone, provides education and tools to help women learn about and manage their reproductive health and fertility.

Groove is passionate about expanding access to education, and has committed to <a class="text-link" href="/blog/2015/09/16/new-partnership-groove-femme-international-impact/">donate 10 percent of company revenue</a> to Femme&rsquo;s Feminine Health Management Program, which seeks to improve health, increase knowledge, and reduce harmful stigmas by working directly with girls in East African communities.

Groove&rsquo;s bi-annual donations will further enable Femme International to provide sustainable, reusable menstrual products to girls involved in Femme&rsquo;s <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.femmeinternational.org/feminine-health-management-program.html">Feminine Health Management Programs</a>.

Groove cofounder and CEO, Jennifer Aldoretta, explains why this partnership is important to her and to Groove:

“Groove is built on the fundamental belief that education is a human right. Millions of women and girls across the globe are deprived of that right due to a biological function they can&rsquo;t control, and that just doesn&rsquo;t sit well with us,” says Aldoretta. “We would be hypocrites to preach expanding access to menstrual health education if we didn&rsquo;t personally support organizations like Femme that are working to do just that. This partnership is truly in line with our personal and company values, and I&rsquo;m absolutely thrilled to further enable such an incredible organization.”

Sabrina Rubli, cofounder of Femme International, says about the partnership:

"While Femme exists to empower school girls in East Africa through health education, our larger goal is to break down the overall menstrual stigma that exists around the world,” says Rubli. “Menstruation is something that all women must deal with, and it is so important to have access to accurate information. Groove is doing an incredible job of encouraging women to get in touch with their bodies through the app, as well as to become aware of the larger issues surrounding menstrual health in developing communities. We are so excited to be working with them, and very grateful for their support!"
