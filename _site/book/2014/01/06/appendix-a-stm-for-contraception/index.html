						<div class="blog-body">
							<p><p>If you haven't read through Part 3 of this book already, woah there! You're getting a little ahead of yourself. Make sure you have a thorough understanding of the rules of the sympto-thermal method (STM) <em>before</em> reading through this appendix. For those who have read and understand Part 3 of the book, you may pass. This appendix will cover information regarding coming off the pill or other hormonal contraceptives, education recommendations, and a few sample contraception charts. Before we get started, I'd like to mention once again that <em>STM as a form of contraception does not protect against STIs or HIV, so condom use is recommended for those who are concerned about the possible spread of STIs or HIV.</em> It's also very important to remember that the effectiveness of STM is directly correlated to how strictly and consistently the rules are adhered to.</p>

<h2>Additional Education</h2>

<p>While reading through this appendix, keep in mind that while this information may be sufficient for many women to practice contraception using STM, others may find that their fertility signals just don't quite match up with what they were expecting&mdash;especially for those women who recently stopped using hormonal contraception or are thinking of doing so. If you or your partner is struggling to interpret fertility signals, if you think there may be an underlying reproductive issue, or if you simply have questions you would like answered, I would highly recommend that you get in touch with a fertility awareness educator. In Appendix D you will find a whole list of qualified individuals who will gladly provide you with extra education and guidance.</p>

<p>Premenopausal and post-partum women can also use STM as a form of contraception despite large variations in hormone levels during these stages of reproductive life. However, it will likely take a great deal of dedication and extremely consistent charting. Explaining how STM can be used for contraception in perimenopausal and post-partum women is beyond the scope of this book. For more information on that subject, get in touch with one of the fine folks listed in Appendix D.</p>

<h2>From Hormonal Contraceptives to Fertility Awareness</h2>

<p>There are many things for a woman to consider before making the switch from a hormonal contraceptive to fertility awareness, the most notable being the menstrual cycle irregularity she will experience as a result of stopping the hormones. Each woman will have a different post-hormone experience, but cycle irregularity should be expected for at least the first several cycles after stopping. I must stress that using STM for contraception is <em>not</em> a good idea until the menstrual cycle has resumed a healthy pattern. For further guidance, get in touch with a fertility awareness educator.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>After I decided to begin cycling au natural and made the switch from hormonal contraception, I wasn't sure what to expect. I began charting my fertility signs immediately, even though I wasn't planning to use it as a form of contraception until I was confident that my cycle had normalized. I visited many online forums to find support from other women in the same situation, and I was shocked to learn that many women didn't resume menstruating until more than six months after stopping hormonal contraception!</em></p>

<p><em>That hopefully gives you an idea of the immense impact this drug has on the female endocrine and reproductive systems. It was very telling to see these women admitting that, for the first time in their lives, they actually <strong>looked forward</strong> to getting their period...a thought that feels foreign to many women. I was lucky and experienced my first post-pill period only a month after I stopped the meds, but my cycle and fertility signs were far from "normal" for nearly five months. While I was shocked by the amount of time it took my body to recover from the pill, I was fascinated by the fact that, using STM, I could literally <strong>watch</strong> my cycle resuming a healthy rhythm!</em></p></blockquote>

<p>The chart above displays an example post-hormone chart. It's incredible how much our bodies differ in their sensitivities and reactions to a common substance. Some women will resume menstruating almost immediately after ceasing hormone use, while others will wait months (and on rare occasion a year or more) for their periods to return.</p>

<h2>Using STM for Contraception</h2>

<p>As we discussed earlier, if semen, lubricant, or spermicide is not expelled from the vagina, intercourse is only safe every other day on dry days since fertile cervical fluid might be masked. STM as a form of contraception is <em>very</em> unforgiving to risk-taking, so make sure to follow the rules of this method <em>to a tee</em> when using it as birth control.</p>

<p>There are a couple sample birth control charts shown below and on the following page. For assistance with troubleshooting fertility signs, get in touch with a fertility awareness educator (Appendix D)! There are many online resources that provide free blank charts to record daily fertility signs, for those who are interested. There are also several charting apps that will make using STM easier.</p>
