						<div class="blog-body">
							<p><p>We have finally gotten to the good stuff. Before we get started, I must mention that it is <em>imperative</em> that you have a thorough understanding of the information presented in Chapters <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/chapter-4-female-reproductive-organs-and-endocrine-glands">4</a>, <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/chapter-5-female-hormones-and-the-menstrual-cycle">5</a>, and <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/chapter-6-hormone-changes-and-fertility-signals">6</a> before attempting to learn <em>or</em> practice the sympto-thermal method (STM) that is detailed in this chapter. Although there are other methods that fall into the category of "fertility awareness", or FA, (including the Billings Method, which monitors only cervical fluid changes), the sympto-thermal method of FA is the only method that I refer to in this book. Not only is it the most effective method of FA, but it can be used by most women regardless of cycle length, cycle irregularity, or reproductive disorders. When the rules presented here are strictly adhered to, the sympto-thermal method of FA is an extremely effective way to prevent or achieve pregnancy&mdash;or to simply keep track of gynecological health. Just how effective is it? I'll get into that in <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/chapter-9-sympto-thermal-method-effectiveness">Chapter 9</a>. If you're planning to use STM for contraception, conception, or maintaining reproductive health&mdash;or if you're interested in reading more on those subjects&mdash;look to Appendices <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/appendix-a-the-sympto-thermal-method-for-contraception">A</a>, <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/appendix-b-the-sympto-thermal-method-for-conception">B</a>, and <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/appendix-c-the-sympto-thermal-method-for-reproductive-health">C</a>, respectively. An understanding of the STM rules presented in this chapter is necessary to grasp the information in the appendices, so read through Chapters 7, <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/chapter-8-checking-fertility-signs-how-to">8</a>, and <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/chapter-9-sympto-thermal-method-effectiveness">9</a> in their entirety before diving into any of that extra information.</p>

<p>It is absolutely <em>crucial</em> (and I cannot stress this enough) that you read this chapter very carefully before attempting to practice STM. If you don't quite get it after the first read, then read it again! Just make sure you have a good understanding of the material before attempting to use this method for any purpose, but especially as a form of contraception. I also highly recommend that if you do not feel confident in your knowledge of STM (or if you or your partner are confused by any fertility signs), get in touch with a fertility awareness educator to help out with the transition. There are several educators, along with other amazing resources, listed in <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/appendix-d-fertility-awareness-and-menstrual-health-resources">Appendix D</a>.</p>

<p>Another thing I absolutely must bring up, even though I'm confident that you're a smart lassie (or lad), is that <em>practicing a fertility awareness-based method in no way protects you from sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or HIV</em>. Knowing that you (or your partner) are not in the fertile window isn't an invitation or excuse to forgo a condom. I'm not going to give you a full parental lecture, but if you're planning to practice STM (or any other method of fertility awareness) and you're concerned about the possible transmission of STIs or HIV, use a condom!</p>

<p>Ladies and gents, without further ado, I present the rules of STM.</p>

<h3>1. First Five Days Rule</h3>

<p><strong>A woman is considered <em>infertile</em> during the first five days of a new cycle, but <em>only</em> if she experienced a spike in basal body temperature 12 to 16 days prior to menstruation.</strong> Since some women experience mid-cycle spotting or bleeding, it's very important to assume infertility only the first five days of an actual menstrual period, which occurs 12 to 16 days <em>after</em> a rise in BBT. If menstruation lasts beyond the first five days, a woman is potentially fertile due to the possibility of menstrual fluid masking fertile cervical fluid, especially for women who tend to ovulate early. Since a woman must have experienced a temperature shift (indicating ovulation) prior to menstruation, it's important to wait until at least one full cycle has been charted before relying on this rule.</p>

<p><strong>If a woman has experienced <em>any</em> cycles that are less than 25 days in length, if she is just starting out with STM, or if she is perimenopausal, this rule will change to assume infertility only the first three days of a new cycle.</strong> This is due to the possibility of early ovulation and a fertile window that begins early enough in the cycle to be masked by menstruation. Any woman starting out with STM must adhere to this alternative rule until it can be confirmed that her cycles are consistently longer than 25 days.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Although rare, it is possible to get pregnant during menstruation. A previous physician of mine swears she got pregnant on the last day of her period. After she admitted she was using the rhythm method at the time, I knew this was due to one of several things (aside from the fact that she was using the rhythm method). Perhaps she ovulated very early during the cycle in quesiton and didn't take previously short cycles into consideration; cervical fluid can easily be masked by menstrual fluid. Or maybe she was experiencing heavy mid-cycle spotting that she mistook for menstruation; mid-cycle spotting is often thought to occur on a woman's most fertile day(s). It is also possible that she didn't ovulate during her previous cycle; if this was the case, she could have had fertile cervical fluid while experiencing withdrawal bleeding (which is not a true menstrual period). She was married at the time, and this surprise pregnancy happily ended in the birth of one of her two lovely daughters. But had she been practicing the sympto-thermal method instead of the outdated, unscientific rhythm method, she could have avoided this unplanned pregnancy!</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>2. Dry Day Rule</h3>

<p>In <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/chapter-6-hormone-changes-and-fertility-signals">Chapter 6</a>, we discussed cervical fluid patterns, and I mentioned that there is typically no fluid on the days following menstruation. However, there are exceptions that I will discuss below. This lack of cervical fluid means sperm cannot survive for more than a few hours in the female body. Because of this, during the time between menstruation and ovulation, <strong>a woman is considered infertile the evening of every day she experiences a dry&mdash;or fluid-less&mdash;day.</strong> As soon as she notices cervical fluid&mdash;whether it is sticky, creamy, egg white, or watery&mdash;sperm are now able to survive in her body and her fertile window is officially open!</p>

<p>This rule specifies evenings as "safe" assuming that a woman checks her cervical fluid at the vaginal opening rather than at its source. If a woman decides to do some spelunking and instead checks her fluid at the opening of the cervix, she will have a much more accurate picture of her fluid type for that day. If she just can't muster the courage to check it at the cervix, she can instead check at the vaginal opening; but she will not be considered infertile until that evening since fluid may take several hours to make the journey from the cervix to the vaginal opening. Since cervical fluid can quickly change from dry to fertile, it's necessary to check several times throughout the day. I will discuss more about how to check cervical fluid in <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/chapter-8-checking-fertility-signs-how-to">Chapter 8</a>.</p>

<p>Some women may find that they <em>always</em> see cervical fluid. It may be sticky day after day with no "dry" days. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this! For example, if a woman charts for several months and establishes that she <em>consistently</em> experiences sticky fluid on the days she would have expected to be "dry", her basic infertile pattern (BIP) is sticky. For these women who do not experience "dry" days, the dry day rule will be different: <strong>a woman who experiences a BIP that is not dry is considered infertile the evening of every day she experiences <em>no change</em> in her cervical fluid.</strong> These women who experience non-dry BIPs must use incredible care when checking cervical fluid to ensure they are getting an accurate representation. When in doubt, don't take the risk!</p>

<p>Semen, lubricants, and spermicides can all mask cervical fluid. If any of these are present in the vagina during "dry" days, it's important for them to be expelled so they don't mask potentially fertile fluid on the following day. An easy way for a woman to expel these substances is to perform kegels&mdash;which is the repeated contraction and relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles. A great way to practice is to start and stop your urine stream in the middle of using the bathroom...that's a kegel! <strong>If semen, lubricant, or spermicide is not expelled from the vagina after intercourse, then unprotected intercourse is not safe on the following day since each one has the potential to mask fertile cervical fluid.</strong></p>

<h3>2a. Doering Rule</h3>

<p>The "Doering Rule" that I'm about to discuss is a conservative addition to the "Dry Day Rule" for those who may want a little extra protection. I'd like to note that adding the Doering Rule is not necessary to properly practice STM; it's all a matter of personal preference. Practicing this rule in addition to the others will make STM more effective, but it will typically lead to a longer window of abstinence or barrier backup use. If this rule is added, <em>it is used in addition to the Dry Day Rule.</em> Because the use of the Doering Rule adds a calendar-based rule to the sympto-thermal method, at least 12 cycles of charts are required before it is used. The Doering Rule states that <strong>a woman's fertile window begins seven days before the earliest cycle day on which a temperature shift has occurred over the past 12 cycles.</strong> However, if cervical fluid is seen before this "Doering day", the fertile window is open. Presence of cervical fluid before the "Doering day" <em>always</em> overrides the Doering Rule.</p>

<p>For example, if the earliest temperature shift that Mary has experienced during the past year occurred on cycle day 16 (the rest were on cycle days 17-20), then she would consider her fertile window open on cycle day nine of each cycle (16 &ndash; 7 = 9). However, during Mary's last cycle, she noticed cervical fluid on cycle day eight, and she, therefore, considered cycle day eight the start of her fertile window instead of cycle day nine. It's imperative that the Doering Rule is <em>only</em> practiced if at least twelve cycles of BBT data are available, because it is possible to ovulate on cycle day 20 during one cycle and cycle day 12 the very next cycle.</p>

<h3>3. Peak Day Rule</h3>

<p>The last day of slippery, fertile quality cervical fluid is considered the peak day. Because the peak day is the <em>last day</em> of slippery fluid, a woman won't be able to identify her peak day until the following day. Some women may never experience slippery, fertile quality fluid. For these women, the peak day is the last day of the most fertile type of fluid observed, even if it is not slippery, watery, or egg white. The peak day may occur a few days before ovulation, and is generally the most fertile day of the menstrual cycle. <strong>On the evening of the fourth day after her peak day, a woman is considered infertile for the remainder of her cycle.</strong> We'll discuss how to identify peak day more in <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/chapter-8-checking-fertility-signs-how-to">Chapter 8</a>.</p>

<h3>4. Temperature Shift Rule</h3>

<p>A sudden shift in basal body temperature occurs the day a woman's BBT is at least 0.2 °F (or 0.1 ºC) higher than the <em>highest</em> temperature she recorded during the previous six days. That means that if she looks back at her BBT for the previous six days (not including today), and the highest temperature that occurred in that group is at least 0.2 °F (or 0.1 ºC) lower than today's temperature, she can assume today is the day of her temperature shift. Many women do not experience this "sudden" shift, but I will discuss that more below.</p>

<p>To make these high, post-ovulatory temperatures easier to visualize, a woman will draw a horizontal line&mdash;called a coverline&mdash;across her chart. I'll discuss how to draw a coverline after we go through the remaining STM rules. <strong>After three consecutive days when BBT is above the coverline, a woman is considered infertile, starting in the evening, for the remainder of her current cycle.</strong></p>

<p>If a woman's BBT drops below the coverline during any of the first three days after her temperature shift, she must restart the three-day count. Additionally, if any BBT readings during those first three days after the temperature shift are either artificially high or missing, the three-day count must be restarted. Please note that these two approaches are <em>very conservative</em>, and if you choose not to follow these approaches, there will be an extra risk encountered. For example, if Katherine's BBT drops below the coverline (or if it is artificially high or she simply forgot to take it) on the second day after her temperature shift, to be conservative she would restart her count. However, if Katherine <em>acknowledges</em> and is <em>okay</em> with the extra risk, she can resume her count the following day.</p>

<p>I will discuss how to pick out an artificially high BBT reading in <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/chapter-8-checking-fertility-signs-how-to">Chapter 8</a>. The charts that follow display the temperature shift rule as it applies to the two types of temperature shifts: "sudden" and "slow-rise".</p>

<div class="book-image-container">
    <img class="book-image" src="/img/book/image4.jpg" alt="This woman experienced a sudden temperature shift. On cycle day 16, her BBT was 98.1 ºF (36.75 ºC), which is 0.4 ºF (0.2 ºC) higher than any of the previous six days. Since her BBT on this day is at least 0.2 ºF (0.1 ºC) above any of the previous six days, she can assume cycle day 16 is the day of her temperature shift. On cycle day 19, after three consecutive days of a BBT that is above the coverline, she is considered infertile (starting in the evening) for the remainder of her cycle. When practicing contraception, she must also adhere to the Double-Check Rule explained below."/>
    <p class="small-text">This woman experienced a sudden temperature shift. On cycle day 16, her BBT was 98.1 ºF (36.75 ºC), which is 0.4 ºF (0.2 ºC) higher than any of the previous six days.

When practicing contraception, she must also adhere to the Double-Check Rule explained below.</p>
</div>


<p>Not all women will experience a sudden temperature shift after ovulation. Some will experience a slow-rise temperature pattern, where BBT will rise in increments of about 0.1 °F (or 0.05 ºC). For women who experience this type of rise, the temperature shift will occur on the day that BBT is at least 0.1 °F (or 0.05 ºC) higher than the highest BBT that occurred during the previous six days. The post-ovulatory infertile period in this case begins in the evening on the <em>fourth consecutive day</em> that BBT is above the coverline. If BBT falls below the coverline, wasn't taken, or is artificially high for any reason during any of these four days, the count must be restarted. The rules for drawing a coverline in this case are different than with a sudden temperature shift, and I'll discuss this later in the chapter. A sample chart displaying a slow-rise temperature pattern is shown below.</p>

<div class="book-image-container">
    <img class="book-image" src="/img/book/image5.jpg" alt="This woman experienced a slow-rise temperature shift.

</div>


<h3>5. Double-Check Rule</h3>

<p>This last rule is somewhat redundant, but it's very important to follow. It is possible that the fourth day after the peak day and the third day after the temperature shift will occur on the same day. If this is not the case, <strong>a woman must wait until both the "Peak Day Rule" and the "Temperature Shift Rule" are true before she considers herself infertile for the remainder of her current cycle</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, the fourth day after Wendy's peak day is on a Tuesday and the third day after her temperature shift occurs the next day on Wednesday. In this case, Wendy can consider herself infertile on Wednesday evening after both rules are satisfied.</p>

<h3>Optional Cervical Position Check</h3>

<p>As we've learned, the position and hardness of the cervix changes with fluctuating estrogen and progesterone levels. Estrogen secretion before ovulation causes changes in both the cervix (including making it softer and more open) and the cervical fluid (causing it to become progressively clear, stretchy, and slippery). Progesterone secretion after ovulation causes these changes to reverse and produces a sustained rise in BBT.</p>

<p>After ovulation, as sort of a "confirmation" that the infertile period has begun, many women will check the position of the cervix to confirm that it has returned to its infertile (low, firm, and closed) position. It is a great way to provide a little extra peace of mind! I will discuss how to check cervical position, and what to look for, in <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/chapter-8-checking-fertility-signs-how-to">Chapter 8</a>.</p>

<h2>Sympto-thermal Method Rules Summary</h2>

<p>While that bigger, more educated brain of yours processes all of the information I just dumped on you, here is a breakdown of the rules you just learned.</p>

<blockquote><p> <strong>1. First Five Days Rule:</strong> a woman is considered <em>infertile</em> during the first five days of a new cycle, but <em>only</em> if she experienced a spike in basal body temperature 12 to 16 days prior to menstruation. However, if a woman has experienced <em>any</em> cycles that are less than 25 days in length (or if she is perimenopausal or just starting out with STM) this rule will change to assume infertility only the first three days of a new cycle.</p>

<p> <strong>2. Dry Day Rule:</strong> a woman is considered infertile the evening of every day she experiences a dry&mdash;or fluid-less&mdash;day. <em>Or</em> a woman who experiences a sticky basic infertile pattern (BIP) is considered infertile the evening of every day she experiences <em>no change</em> in her BIP. Additionally, <strong>if semen, lubricant, or spermicide is not expelled from the vagina after intercourse, then unprotected intercourse is not safe on the following day since each one has the potential to mask fertile cervical fluid.</strong></p>

<p> <strong>2a.  Doering Rule (a conservative addition to the Dry Day Rule):</strong> a woman's fertile window begins seven days before the earliest cycle day on which a temperature shift has occurred over the past 12 cycles. <em>At least 12 cycles of BBT data are necessary to use this rule.</em> Presence of cervical fluid will always override this rule.</p>

<p> <strong>3. Peak Day Rule:</strong> on the fourth evening after her peak day, a woman is considered infertile for the remainder of her current cycle.</p>

<p> <strong>4. Temperature Shift Rule:</strong> after three consecutive days of a BBT that is above the coverline, a woman is considered infertile, starting in the evening, for the remainder of her current cycle. For a slow-rise temperature shift, this rule will require <em>four</em> consecutive days of a BBT above the coverline before she is considered infertile.</p>

<p> <strong>5. Double-Check Rule:</strong> a woman must wait until both the "Peak Day Rule" <em>and</em> the "Temperature Shift Rule" are satisfied before she considers herself infertile for the remainder of her current cycle.</p></blockquote>

<p>The next page displays a sample chart showing all of the STM rules in action.</p>

<h2>How to Draw a Coverline</h2>

<p>Drawing a coverline isn't totally necessary, but doing so will make it much easier to visualize the temperature shift. I mentioned that some women experience a sudden temperature shift, while others have a slow-rise pattern. The rules for drawing the coverline are different for each of these two scenarios.</p>

<p>For a woman who experiences a <strong>sudden temperature shift</strong>&mdash;meaning the temperature shift occurs on the day when BBT is at least 0.2 °F (or 0.1 ºC) higher than the <em>highest</em> BBT that occurred during the previous six days&mdash;the coverline is drawn horizontally across the chart 0.1 °F (or 0.05 ºC) higher than the highest BBT that occurred in the six days immediately prior to the temperature shift. The vertical line shown in the chart below simply makes it easier to distinguish post-ovulatory "high" and pre-ovulatory "low" basal temperatures.</p>

<div class="book-image-container">
    <img class="book-image" src="/img/book/image7.jpg" alt="This woman experienced a sudden temperature shift. It occurred on cycle day 16 since her BBT on that day was at least 0.2 ºF (or 0.1 ºC) above the group of temperatures circled in red. The highest temperature that occurred in the BBT cluster circled in red is 97.7 ºF (or 36.55 ºC), so the coverline in this case is drawn at 97.8 ºF (or 36.60 ºC)."/>
    <p class="small-text">This woman experienced a sudden temperature shift. It occurred on cycle day 16 since her BBT on that day was at least 0.2 ºF (or 0.1 ºC) above the group of temperatures circled in red. The highest temperature that occurred in the BBT cluster circled in red is 97.7 ºF (or 36.55 ºC), so the coverline in this case is drawn at 97.8 ºF (or 36.60 ºC).</p>
</div>


<p>A woman who experiences a <strong>slow-rise temperature shift</strong>&mdash;meaning a temperature that rises in about 0.1 °F (or 0.05 ºC) increments&mdash;will draw her coverline horizontally across the chart <em>through</em> the day that her BBT is at least 0.1 °F (or 0.05 ºC) higher than the highest BBT that occurred in the previous six days. If you're still confused, take a look at the example chart below. Again, the vertical line shown in the chart makes it easier to distinguish post-ovulatory "high" from pre-ovulatory "low" temperatures.</p>

<div class="book-image-container">
    <img class="book-image" src="/img/book/image8.jpg" alt="This woman experienced a slow-rise temperature shift. Since cycle day 16 had a BBT at least 0.1 ºF (or 0.05 ºC) above the cluster of temperatures circled in red (the previous six days), cycle day 16 is the day of her temperature shift. The highest temperature that occurred in the BBT cluster circled in red is 97.6 ºF (or 36.50 ºC), so the coverline in this case is drawn at 97.7 ºF (or 36.55 ºC), THROUGH her BBT on cycle day 16."/>

<p>So, that's that! The sympto-thermal method of FA may seem a bit overwhelming at first, but what isn't? Learning to tie your shoes was probably pretty stressful when you were first figuring it out, too. The benefits of practicing STM&mdash;whether it's for birth control, pregnancy achievement, or simply to maintain optimum health&mdash;quickly become apparent after starting out. You might even be asking yourself why you ever resorted to using anything else!</p>
