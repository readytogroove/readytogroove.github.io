Howdy!

After months and months of hard work, I'm so thrilled to announce that Groove's <a class="text-link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id831795151">Period &amp; Fertility Tracker</a> app is now available in the iOS App Store in the United States! We did some cheering (and a bit of high-fiving) because we couldn't be more excited about everything that's in store for Groove. And we simply can't wait to share our app with you.

Our number one priority at Groove is YOU, and our aim is to make the absolute best cycle tracking and fertility charting app available...because YOU deserve it! If you love our app as much as we do, we hope you'll leave us a review in the App Store to help other people find out about us. If you have suggestions or feedback (good or bad...we want to know!), send us an email at <a class="text-link" href="mailto:howdy@readytogroove.com">howdy@readytogroove.com</a>.

Let's get Groovin', y'all!
