When Brian and I started Groove, we knew we wanted it to be great. But what does that mean, really? 

Creating great products is more than writing code, whipping up designs, and knowing our stuff. For us, it means never compromising our standards of quality (and they're pretty darned high). It means never making decisions haphazardly, and having you, our customer, in mind with every single thing we do. 

Truly great products are hard to find&mdash;especially great products made for women. We want to help change that. We want to help set a new standard of quality for other companies like us, because women deserve great products. 

We want you to feel a connection with our app&mdash;the type of connection that can only be produced by a product crafted by a ridiculously passionate team of individuals. 

We love what we do, and we hope that it shows with every click.
