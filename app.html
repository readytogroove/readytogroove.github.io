			        The sympto-thermal method of fertility awareness is a scientifically-based method of determining when during your unique menstrual cycle you are fertile...and you're not fertile every day! Practicing the sympto-thermal method allows you to naturally and effectively avoid a pregnancy, get pregnant quickly and easily, and monitor your reproductive health. It requires that you practice a simple set of rules and monitor two scientifically-backed signs of fertility: (1) cervical fluid and (2) basal body temperature. <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="/the-cycle">Learn the sympto-thermal method for free</a>, right from our website!

			        Groove’s advanced Fertility Charting account has all the amazing features you need to practice the sympto-thermal method of fertility awareness. The sympto-thermal method is an incredible way to take control of your reproductive health, and it requires the daily charting of two simple fertility signs: (1) cervical fluid and (2) basal body temperature. The sympto-thermal method can be used as a form of natural and effective birth control, as a tool to help you get pregnant quickly, or as a tool to monitor your reproductive health! <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="/the-cycle">Learn how to practice the sympto-thermal method for free</a>.

			        Each cycle, your cervix produces fluid. This fluid is a perfectly natural and healthy bodily secretion! Monitoring cervical fluid allows you to pinpoint the beginning of your fertile window each cycle, and it’s an excellent way to make sure your reproductive system is in good health. Learning how to check your cervical fluid is both simple and incredibly useful. <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="/the-cycle/chapter-6-hormone-changes-and-fertility-signals/#what-is-cervical-fluid">Read more about cervical fluid on our website</a> or get in touch with a <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="/the-cycle/appendix-d-fertility-awareness-and-menstrual-health-resources">Fertility Awareness Educator</a>.

			        Basal body temperature (BBT) is your body’s core temperature at rest, and it's a super important fertility sign! After ovulation occurs, your body produces a hormone called progesterone that causes your BBT to rise and stay high for the rest of the cycle. Tracking your BBT helps confirm ovulation and the end of your fertile window. <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="/the-cycle/chapter-6-hormone-changes-and-fertility-signals/#what-is-bbt">Learn more about basal body temperature</a>.
