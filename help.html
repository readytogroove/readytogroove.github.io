			        Our app has two account types: (1) Cycle Tracking and (2) Fertility Charting. Grooveâ€™s advanced Fertility Charting account has all the amazing features you need to practice the sympto-thermal method of fertility awareness to find out precisely when you&rsquo;re fertile. The sympto-thermal method is an incredible way to take control of your reproductive health, and it requires the daily charting of two simple fertility signs: (1) cervical fluid and (2) basal body temperature. The sympto-thermal method can be used to naturally and effectively avoid pregnancy, as a tool to help you get pregnant quickly, or as a tool to monitor your reproductive health! <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle">Learn how to practice the sympto-thermal method for free</a>.

			        Every month, your body experiences hormone changes that cause you to get your period, and these fluctuating hormone levels show up as physical changes in your body. Our app uses this information, coupled with reproductive science, to predict your upcoming periods, helping you get an accurate picture of what&rsquo;s going on in your body. Even if your cycles are irregular, don&rsquo;t fret. Our advanced Fertility Charting account can help you make sense of your cycles and will predict upcoming periods with amazing accuracy. <!-- <a class="text-link" href="/blog/2014-10-08-tracking-your-cycles-with-groove">Learn more about using Groove to track your cycles</a>. -->

			        Throughout your cycle, your cervix produces a special fluid that causes you to become fertile. This cervical fluid undergoes changes during your cycle, becoming progressively more wet and slippery &ndash; and more hospitable to sperm &ndash; as ovulation gets closer. Monitoring the changes in your cervical fluid allows you to pinpoint which days you are and aren&rsquo;t able to get pregnant, and it&rsquo;s an excellent way to make sure your reproductive system is in good health. Learning how to check your cervical fluid is both simple and incredibly useful. You can <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/chapter-6-hormone-changes-and-fertility-signals/#what-is-cervical-fluid">read more about cervical fluid</a> on our website or get in touch with a <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/appendix-d-fertility-awareness-and-menstrual-health-resources">fertility awareness educator</a> for some one-on-one guidance.

			        Basal body temperature (BBT) is defined is your body&rsquo;s core temperature at rest. There is only a fraction of your cycle when a pregnancy is possible, and measuring your BBT helps you determine exactly when that is. Measuring BBT confirms ovulation and can also be useful in the detection of hormone imbalance. The best time to measure your BBT is first thing in the morning when you wake up, before you get out of bed or drink water. <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/chapter-6-hormone-changes-and-fertility-signals/#what-is-bbt">Learn more about basal body temperature</a>.

			        The sympto-thermal method of fertility awareness (STM) is a scientifically-based method of determining when during your unique menstrual cycle you are fertile...and you&rsquo;re not fertile every day! Practicing the sympto-thermal method allows you to avoid pregnancy without the use of hormones or devices, maximize your chances of getting pregnant, and monitor your reproductive health. It also allows you to accurately determine when you can expect your next period. Practicing this method requires that you follow a simple set of rules and monitor two scientifically-backed signs of fertility: (1) <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/chapter-6-hormone-changes-and-fertility-signals/#what-is-cervical-fluid">cervical fluid</a> and (2) <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/chapter-6-hormone-changes-and-fertility-signals/#what-is-bbt">basal body temperature</a>.
