			        The very first time you open the Groove app, you will be asked a series of questions about your family planning goals (or lack thereof) and about your cycles. Groove uses this information to provide you with a highly curated app experience, customizing and tailoring everything in your app from your data fields to the educational information that helps you learn about your body. This helps you track the data that matters to <em>you</em>, eliminating all the fluff. Not interested in getting pregnant? Then you probably don&rsquo;t care about entering data about ovulation predictor kits! Your body and your cycles are <em>unique</em>, and we think <em>your</em> app should reflect that. Are you ready to Groove?! <a class="text-link" href="/app/">Learn more about the Groove app</a>.

			        Groove has two account types: (1) Groove Basic and (2) Groove Pro. Groove Basic helps you track your cycles and predict upcoming periods with awesome accuracy. The advanced Groove Pro has all the amazing features you need to practice the sympto-thermal method of fertility awareness to avoid pregnancy without hormones or devices, to maximize your chances of getting pregnant, to keep tabs on your reproductive health, or (for those of you with irregular cycles) to predict the start of your next period with amazing accuracy! The sympto-thermal method is an incredible way to take control of your reproductive health, and it requires the daily observation of two simple things: (1) <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.whatiscervicalfluid.com">cervical fluid</a> and (2) <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/chapter-6-hormone-changes-and-fertility-signals/#what-is-bbt">basal body temperature</a>.

			        Every month, your body experiences hormone changes that cause you to get your period. These fluctuating hormone levels cause certain changes in your body, like changes in your <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.whatiscervicalfluid.com">cervical fluid</a>. Our advanced algorithms use modern science&mdash;plus the information you enter into your app about your cervical fluid and/or <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/chapter-6-hormone-changes-and-fertility-signals/#what-is-bbt">basal body temperature</a>&mdash;to predict your upcoming periods. This means you&rsquo;ll never be caught off guard, and you&rsquo;ll always have an accurate picture of what&rsquo;s going on in your body. Even if your cycles are irregular, don&rsquo;t fret. Groove Pro can help you make sense of your cycles and will predict your periods with amazing accuracy. <a class="text-link" href="/blog/2015/03/10/tracking-your-cycles-with-groove/">Learn more about using Groove to track your cycles</a>.

			        You are only fertile for a portion of the menstrual cycle, which means that your baby-making window is relatively limited. The Groove app allows you to track scientifically-backed signs of fertility to determine exactly when you&rsquo;re fertile. That way, you can time intercourse to improve your chances of conceiving quickly. Charting your fertility not only helps you maximize your chances of getting pregnant, but it can also help you identify signs of potential infertility. <a class="text-link" href="/blog/2014/07/04/how-to-get-pregnant-while-charting-your-fertility">Learn more about charting your fertility to get pregnant</a>.

			        Throughout your cycle, your cervix produces a special fluid that causes you to become fertile. This <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.whatiscervicalfluid.com">cervical fluid</a> undergoes changes during your cycle, becoming <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/appendix-e-visualizing-cervical-fluid-changes/">progressively more wet and slippery</a>&mdash;and more hospitable to sperm&mdash;as ovulation gets closer. Monitoring the changes in your cervical fluid allows you to pinpoint which days you are and aren&rsquo;t able to get pregnant. It&rsquo;s also an excellent way to make sure your reproductive system is in good health. Learning <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/chapter-8-checking-fertility-signs-how-to/#how-to-check-cervical-fluid">how to check your cervical fluid</a> is both simple and incredibly useful.

				       Measuring your basal body temperature (BBT) is a window into the natural hormone fluctuations that happen during your cycle. Measuring it confirms ovulation and can be useful in the detection of hormone imbalance. Your BBT also helps you determine when you are and aren&rsquo;t fertile on any given day. <a class="text-link" href="/img/book/sympto-thermal-fertility-awareness-method-basal-body-temperature-pattern-confirm-ovulation-chart.jpg">See how your basal body temperature changes throughout your menstrual cycle.</a> The best time to measure your BBT is first thing in the morning when you wake up, before you get out of bed or drink water. <a class="text-link" href="/the-cycle/chapter-6-hormone-changes-and-fertility-signals/#what-is-bbt">Learn more about basal body temperature</a>.
