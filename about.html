    <h3 class="gray-very-light">Groove was born out of our CEO&rsquo;s personal struggle with her reproductive health and the realization that she wasn&rsquo;t alone in this struggle. We&rsquo;re on a mission to redefine what it means to be a women&rsquo;s health company, and we&rsquo;re committed to empowering people with education and tools to help them learn about and manage reproductive health and fertility.</h3>
    <h3 class="gray-very-light">Education is at the core of our mission, and we wholeheartedly believe that companies like ours have a responsibility to affect positive change. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve pledged to donate <a class="text-link" href="http://www.femmeinternational.org/">10% of all proceeds</a> to charities that empower women for as long as our company exists.</h3>

					<h2 class="gray-dark groover-title"><span itemprop="name">Jennifer Aldoretta</span>, <span itemprop="jobTitle">Co-Groover &amp; CEO</span></h2>
					<p class="gray-light groover-info">Jennifer studied mechanical engineering at <span itemprop="alumniOf">Georgia Tech</span> in Atlanta. Frustrated by the lack of education and innovation in women&rsquo;s health, she was led to quit her job as an engineer in pursuit of a grand vision. She is passionate about the intersection of health care and technology and believes that <span itemprop="affiliation">Groove</span>&rsquo;s mission has the power to create widespread social change at a fundamental level. Jennifer loves teaching people about menstruation and is obsessed with reproductive health, design, coding, and the microbiome. She can often be spotted riding around Austin on her bicycle, reading medical journals, and lounging with her dog, Bailey.</p>
