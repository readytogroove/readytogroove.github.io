				<h2 class="gray-dark groover-title">Jennifer Aldoretta, Co-Groover & CEO</h2>
				<p class="gray-light groover-info">Jennifer studied mechanical engineering at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. Frustrated by the lack of innovation in birth control and conception tools, she was led to quit her job as an engineer in pursuit of a grand vision. She is passionate about the intersection of healthcare and technology and is devoted to transforming the status quo. When she's not working or telling corny jokes, Jennifer enjoys cycling, running, traveling, reading, painting, and lounging with her dog Bailey.</p>
