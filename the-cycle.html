            <p class="gray-light">You&rsquo;re only able to get pregnant for a fraction of the menstrual cycle, but, sadly, this isn&rsquo;t common knowledge. It&rsquo;s simple to determine exactly when you&rsquo;re fertile using something called the sympto-thermal method of fertility awareness&mdash;sometimes referred to as the fertility awareness method, or FAM.</p> 
            <p class="gray-light">The links on this page are excerpts from <em>The Cycle</em>, a free book written by our CEO, Jennifer. These excerpts will teach you how to chart your fertility to avoid pregnancy without hormones or devices, to maximize your chances of getting pregnant, to accurately predict upcoming periods, or to monitor your reproductive health.
